# Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1
# if needle is not part of haystack.

# Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
# The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
haystack = "leetcode"
needle = "leeto"


# if needle in haystack:
#     print(haystack.find(needle))
#
# else:
#     print(-1)
